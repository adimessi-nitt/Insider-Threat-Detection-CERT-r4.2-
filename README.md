# Insider-Threat-Detection-CERT-r4.2-
Based on the CERT r4.2 dataset, for those who are new to this, the dataset provides log details of 1000 employees of a company, the time at which they used their pc, their mail list etc... 
The first step or approach would be to develop an efficient feature extraction technique as the dataset is pretty huge and the details are scattered. I have taken a granular approach by looking at the details collectively for a month, week and a day.
As of now i am only in the beginning stage and i would like to suggest an alternate approach by looking at the role of each employee or maybe a combined method of granularisation and role based segregation. 
Right now I am interested in applying NLP on the HTTP file and find out if it leads to any improvements.
For those already working in this or has any idea/suggestion, feel free comment...
